## How to use the system


### For Application Installation:

1. Make sure you have installed Node.js and NPM
2. Install Hbase and host it at port 2181
3. access to the folder and do 'npm install'
4. do 'npm start'

Then you can use the application at http://localhost:3000

### For Data Transfer:

A set of data is prepared in the folder in dataset_bonds.xlsx.
You can just do 'node data_transfer.js' to transfer the data into the database.
But remember to host the database at port 2181 first.
